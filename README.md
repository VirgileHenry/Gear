# Gear

### Intro

Gear is a rust game engine made with the goal of : 
- building a game engine for personnal learn and accomplishments
- making a rust game engine 
- use in future games projects

The main philosophy for this engine is to only use ressources for what you need, meaning a minimalist use of it would result in small and perdormant applications. 

It is built over the [Foundry](https://github.com/VirgileHenry/Foundry) entity component system, made with the goal of supplying this engine.
